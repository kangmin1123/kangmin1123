                <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
                <p>
                    HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. As I mentioned, Coding is a language, and as you can see, HTMLâ€™s L is language. This language is to make the web pages. When HTML programmers use the HTML, they mostly work and use this language with JavaScript and CSS. HTML will include themain elements in the webpages and JavaScript and CSS will be decoration. 

                    Have you ever seen HTML web page before? HTML webpage is mostly personal page, and it is way faster than other websites since it is a personal website. .com, .edu .it these are all not personal websites. It is company, university or lab websites. Therefore, when we do the researches, we definitely can noticed that HTML websites load way faster than other types of websites. 
                    
                    Other types of websites require the main storage bank to store every information. So the computers needs to go back to the storage bank. Since those types of websites have their own main storage bank, their storage is actually infinite. However, all HTML has a limit. There is no specific amount of storage, but if you put too much information, it will make massive sound of fan and the server will be turned off.

                <h2>
                    Origin of HTML
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was invented in 1980 by physicist Tim. At the beginning, it was not successful for him. Nowadays, HTML has been developed well and approved well that it became one of most well-known and standard language that we mostly use and know. And after 13 years, it became standard like thesedays.
