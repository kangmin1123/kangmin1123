                    HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. As I mentioned, Coding is a language, and as you can see, HTMLâ€™s L is language. This language is to make the web pages. Mostly work with JavaScript and CSS. HTML will include the elements in the webpages and JavaScript and CSS will be decoration. 

                    Have you ever seen HTML web page before?
